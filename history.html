                Double System Education Program
                (link and match), was established on 19 February 1986 using the name “Technocrat Course and Guidance”
                with the permission of
                the Ministry of Education and Culture (Depdiknas) of Lampung Province. This institution was founded by
                Nasrullah Yusuf with a capital
                of a used Bajaj motorcycle which was sold for IDR 1,600,000. At the beginning of its establishment, it
                only used one building that was
                rented for Rp. 1,000,000 per year, with equipment designed by themselves, namely two chalkboards, 50
                wooden chairs, one administrative desk,
                and a manual typewriter.

                The programs held at the beginning of its establishment were still limited to courses in English,

                (2 classes), 22 residents studying
                Accounting, and 8 residents learning manual typing. In May 1986 Tutoring began with 3 participants.
